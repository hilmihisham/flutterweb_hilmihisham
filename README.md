# flutterweb_hilmihisham
An experimental weekend project by me to convert my static webpage to Flutter webapp, as a way to understand more about building an app using this framework.

Original webpage can be accessed at [hilmihisham.com](http://www.hilmihisham.com/)

## Intro
This project is my starting point for creating a Flutter application. Of course, I do have other application idea to create, but I'm still not quite well versed on building a project using Flutter. Following tutorials can only get me so far, so I decided to experiment on this framework by converting things that I've already build myself - my own webpage.

## Project Screenshots
- Side-by-side comparison of index page (Flutter vs Static HTML)

## Project Updates
- Initial commit (17 Oct 2020)
